[fa-icon](https://github.com/NowComponents/kb-approval-card)

The icon set has been loaded as a component named `fa-icon` and works similarly to how `now-icon` works. For example:

```
<fa-icon icon="check" size="lg" spin="true"></fa-icon>
```

The list of icons that can be used with this component can be found here:

Below is a screenshot of the demo component I created that uses `fa-icon` as a subcomponent.
